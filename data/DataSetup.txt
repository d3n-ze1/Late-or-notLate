DISCLAIMER
-------------------------------------
This tool is an independent, personal, or educational project and is **not affiliated with or officially endorsed** by Halifax Transit or any other transit agency.

Users are responsible for ensuring they comply with the data usage terms provided by the official data source.

Data accuracy is subject to the source feed, and no guarantees are made regarding the timeliness, completeness, or correctness of the displayed transit information.

---------------------------------
What is the Static_data.zip file?
---------------------------------
The file located at:
    /data/Static_data.zip

contains GTFS (General Transit Feed Specification) data, including:
- Stops
- Routes
- Trips
- Schedules
- Agency information

The program reads this data to provide real-time or static transit details.

---------------------------
How to Replace or Update It
---------------------------

✅ FOR HALIFAX TRANSIT:
1️⃣  Visit the official Halifax Transit open data portal or GTFS data source.
2️⃣  Download the **latest GTFS static feed** (usually a `.zip` file).
3️⃣  Rename the file to:
        Static_data.zip
4️⃣  Place it in the project’s `/data/` folder, replacing the existing file.

✅ FOR OTHER CITIES:
1️⃣  Find the official or public GTFS data for your city (check the city’s transit agency website).
2️⃣  Download the **GTFS static feed** as a `.zip` file.
3️⃣  Rename the file to:
        Static_data.zip
4️⃣  Place it in the project’s `/data/` folder, replacing the existing file.

⚠ IMPORTANT:
- Keep the filename exactly as `Static_data.zip`.
- Do **not** unzip the file; the program reads it directly.
- Ensure the zip contains at least:
    - agency.txt
    - stops.txt
    - routes.txt
    - trips.txt
    - stop_times.txt
    - calendar.txt

-------------------------------------
Troubleshooting
-------------------------------------
If you see errors like:
    zipfile.BadZipFile: Bad offset for central directory

Check:
✔ Did you fully download the file (no interrupted downloads)?
✔ Is the `.zip` valid (can you open it manually)?
✔ Did you put it in the correct `/data/` folder?
✔ Did you leave it zipped (not extracted)?

-------------------------------------
Want to Expand Further?
-------------------------------------
If using other cities:
- Make sure their GTFS files follow the standard schema.
- Some features (like alerts or real-time vehicle tracking) might need additional local data or APIs.

Enjoy using Transit Assistant for your city!
